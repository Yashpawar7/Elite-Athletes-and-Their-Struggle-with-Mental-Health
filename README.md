# Elite-Athletes-and-Their-Struggle-with-Mental-Health
## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the BNM817 – Effective Management Consultancy module at Aston Business School (2023–2024).

It applies Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) to analyse the complex and ambiguous problem of mental health challenges among elite athletes.

The project explores stakeholder dynamics, root causes, and systemic interdependencies, providing a structured consulting approach to develop feasible and desirable recommendations for improvement.

## Objectives
To analyse the mental health challenges faced by professional athletes using SSM.

To identify and map stakeholders using Rich Pictures, CATWOE Analysis, and Power-Interest Matrices.

To create Conceptual Models and Root Definitions that represent multiple stakeholder perspectives.

To propose actionable recommendations and change strategies that promote athlete well-being and organisational effectiveness.

## Methodology
This project followed the 7 stages of Soft Systems Methodology (Checkland, 2006):

Unstructured Problem Situation – Understanding the complexity of mental health in elite sports.

Expressed Problem Situation – Developed a Rich Picture to visualise relationships and conflicts.

Root Definitions & CATWOE Analysis – Defined perspectives of key stakeholders (Athletes, Coaches, Sports Organisations, Indian Olympic Association).

Conceptual Models & 3Es – Designed ideal system models for stakeholder improvement.

Comparison with Real World – Analysed gaps and alignment with real-world conditions.

Feasible & Desirable Changes – Proposed practical and sustainable interventions.

Action to Improve – Suggested an action plan using the Ease–Benefit Matrix.
